    "# Conclusion \n",
    "#### New methods for determining the most interesting characteristics in data will be developed as a result of data mining research. Models can be used as a tool in further research as they are created and implemented. Although cross validation has demonstrated that my model does not overfit the data, I believe that further testing is needed to decide which function subset is truly the best.To improve the model's accuracy, further research is needed. I was able to reach the accuracy of ~49.99% which is low but would require more time and research in order to improve my model. \n",
    "#### Hence, I learned a lot from this project and was able to understand the core logic and methods of data mining to create a model which has to be trained. Though, I want to further study this dataset and enhance the accuracy and train my model to the best result in future."
